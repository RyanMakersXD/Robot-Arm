/*
 * Unlike our other sketch, we aren't using the joysticks to control
 * the arm in this sketch.  Instead, the arm will run on a loop that
 * we program.  Each individual motor movement is written sequentially
 * in the loop() function.
 * 
 * You can see how easy it is to control servos when we're not mapping
 * inputs from analog joysticks.  You need to configure three things
 * to control servos: 
 * 1. Include the Servo.h library
 * 2. Create the Servo object using 'Servo <name>;' 
 * 3. Attach the servo object to a pin using '<name>.attach(pin)'
 * 
 * That's it!  Youre ready to write positions to your servo motors.  
 * The below loop will have your arm close the gripper, swing 120
 * degrees, lower istelf, and open the gripper.  Try your own program,
 * and see what you can make your robot arm pick up and move from
 * one point to another!
 *
